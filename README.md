## Representative Functions

- Login and Logout

  Provide a function that the user can log in with the name. After logging in, you can see the sign-out button at the bottom right of the todo list screen. You can log out by clicking the button.

- Manage ToDos

  After logging in, you can see a screen that you can add todo. If you add a todo, it is added on the screen. You can delete a todo by clicking the 'X' button to the right of todo. Scrolls are created when the added todo is out of a specific part of the screen.

- Date, Clock, and Weather

  You can always check the Date, Clock, and Weather on the top of the screen. Display today's date on the left, the current clock in the middle, and the current temperature, location, weather, and weather icon on the right.

## Future Improvements

- Sign Up

  I will improve to manage todo according to the user by adding the signup function. Now anyone can log in, and todo is not saved according to the user.
